      <p>Starting his professional career with Santos FC, Neymar's amazing performances earned him a move to one of the biggest clubs in the world, FC Barcelona, in 2013. During his time at Barcelona, Neymar formed one of the most dangerous attacking trios in football history alongside Lionel Messi and Luis Suárez, known as "MSN." Together, they won numerous trophies, including La Liga, Copa del Rey, and the most important of all, the UEFA Champions League.</p>
      
      <p>In 2017, Neymar chose to switch his path and go to another club, and he was one of if not the most expensive transfer in the world, he chose to go to Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) for a world-record fee. At PSG, Neymar has continued to break records and establish himself as one of the best players in the world. He has led PSG to several domestic titles, including Ligue 1 championships, and played a crucial role in their journey to the UEFA Champions League final in 2020 by 1-0, with an amazing performance from Neymar, it still wasn't enough to win that final.</p>

      <p>In August of 2023, he finally decided it was time to leave the French club, and nobody knew where he was going. Many people thought he would go back to one of his former clubs or maybe choose a new path in England, but he chose to go to the Saudi Arabian club Al Hilal, where he earned more than $100 million Euros per year. However, he spent most of the time there injured due to a match he played while representing the Brazil National Team.</p>
